This code is pretty hacky right now.  I don't have a Makefile yet (run with runhaskell), and it will throw all sorts of warnings.  I'm sort of prototyping as I go, but it works so far.

Dependencies:

libghc-random-dev
libghc-colour-dev
libghc-sdl-dev
libghc-sdl-ttf-dev
libghc-sdl-image-dev
libghc-sdl-gfx-dev
libghc-attoparsec-dev >= 0.10.0.0
libghc-hipmunk-dev >= 5.2.0.9

(also installable from cabal)
