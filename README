== Build Instructions ==

These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, and are not guaranteed on any other platform.

I am using cabal for all Haskell dependencies because some dependencies need to be newer than what is in Ubuntu.  Hopefully, this will change.

=== Install GHC and Cabal ===

	sudo apt-get install ghc cabal-install

=== Install non-Haskell Dependencies ===

	sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

=== Install Haskell Dependencies ===

	cabal update
	cabal install containers SDL SDL-image SDL-ttf SDL-mixer text attoparsec colour StateVar directory filepath random transformers
	cabal install Hipmunk

=== Build BitBrawl ===

	make

=== Done ===

There should now be a binary at dist/build/bitbrawl/bitbrawl that you can run to start the game.

NOTE: there is a make install rule in this Makefile, however **it is not verified to work**.
